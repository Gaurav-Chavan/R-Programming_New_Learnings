* An Application Programming Interface (API) is a broad term that defines the rules that guide your interaction with some software.

* HTTP APIs have become the predominant language by which software communicates.

* By creating an HTTP API, you’ll empower your R code to be leveraged by other services – whether they’re housed inside your organization 
or hosted on the other side of the world. 

* The plumber R package (Trestle Technology, LLC 2017) allows users to expose existing R code as a service available to others on the Web. 
  
Here are just a few ideas of the doors that are opened to you when you wrap your R code in a Plumber API:

1. Software written in other languages in your organization can run your R code.

2. Your company’s Java application could now pull in a custom ggplot2 graph that you generate on-demand, 
   or a Python client could query a predictive model defined in R.

3. You can have some third-party receive emails on your behalf and then notify your Plumber service when new messages arrive.

4. You can write JavaScript code that queries your Plumber API from a visitor’s web browser. 

5. Even further, you could use Plumber exclusively as the back-end of an interactive web application.
