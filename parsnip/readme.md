Other packages, such as caret and mlr, help to solve the R model API issue. 
These packages do a lot of other things too: preprocessing, model tuning, resampling, feature selection, ensembling, and so on.
In the tidyverse, we strive to make our packages modular and parsnip is designed only to solve the interface issue. 
It is not designed to be a drop-in replacement for caret.
