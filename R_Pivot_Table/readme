# R Pivot Tables

I learned how we can create a pivot table in R using rpivotTable library, 
it gives us result is an interactive pivot table rendered in either your default browser or 
the viewer pane of RStudio with single line of code.

More on that, we can also create Heatmap, Barcharts, Line charts and many more.
