Key Points 

* If you can tell the customers what they might want to buy – it not only improves your sales,
  but also the customer experience and ultimately life time value.
 
* For example, I would want the toothbrush, the paste, the mouthwash  & other dental products on a single aisle – because when I buy,
  I tend to buy them together. This is done by a way in which we find associations between items.
 
* Generally, association rules are written in “IF-THEN” format.
  We can also use the term “Antecedent” for IF (LHS) and “Consequent” for THEN (RHS).
 
*  The first 1-Item sets are found by gathering the count of each item in the set.
    Then the 1-Item sets are used to find 2-Item sets and so on until no more k-Item sets can be explored;
    when all our items land up in one final observation.
	
* Support: Support is the basic probability of an event to occur. 
		 If we have an event to buy product A, Support(A) is the number of transactions which includes A divided by total number of transactions.	
	
* Confidence: The confidence of an event is the conditional probability of the occurrence; 
			   the chances of A happening given B has already happened.	
			   
* The lift value tells us how much better a rule is at predicting something than randomly guessing. 
  The higher the lift, the stronger the association.
